> A simple Golang package with a single purpose, to verify messages signed via Bitcoin message signing (BMS).

## Requirements

- Golang 1.18+

## Installation

Your `$PATH` must contain the Go path and the Go `bin` path (see [GoLang's getting started](https://golang.org/doc/install#install) for more information). 

Once done, you can install this package: 
```bash
go get -u github.com/bitonicnl/verify-signed-message
```

## Usage

For examples, checkout the [example](/.example) folder.

## Support

This library tries to support as many signatures as possible.

**Current support:**
- Any wallet that does signing like Electrum, example:
  - Electrum: P2PKH, P2WPKH and P2WPKH-P2SH
  - Coinomi: P2PKH, P2WPKH and P2WPKH-P2SH
  - Samourai: P2PKH, P2WPKH and P2WPKH-P2SH
  - Mycelium: P2PKH, P2WPKH and P2WPKH-P2SH
- Any wallet that allows for legacy address signatures (P2PKH), example:
  - Bitcoin Core
- Any wallet that follows [BIP 137](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0137.mediawiki), example:
  - Trezor: P2PKH, P2WPKH and P2WPKH-P2SH
- Taproot (P2TR)
  - The verification is using the internal key, so only addresses without a tapscript are allowed.

**Currently not supported:**
- Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash (P2WSH)
- BIP-322
